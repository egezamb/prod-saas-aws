# Optional AWS WAF in front of the ALB (enable_waf). AWS's managed rule groups cover the common web
# attacks, known bad inputs and IPs with a bad reputation; a rate-based rule blocks an IP that
# sends more than waf_rate_limit requests in 5 minutes. Off by default: a web ACL costs about $5 a
# month, plus $1 per rule and $0.60 per million requests (docs/COST.md).
